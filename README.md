# PAU: Personal Assistant for Upskilling

## Overview
For the past 6 months since the time I started upskilling, I have been facing a lot of challenges to keep a track of my regular progress. Hence, I have created this tool, PAU, which will help a lot of people like me to check their progress by providing them with tools, resources, revisions, and insights tailored to their learning journey.

PAU (Personal Assistant for Upskilling) is an innovative application designed to help individuals enhance their skills and grow professionally. It serves as a personalized guide for upskilling, providing tools, resources, and insights tailored to the user's learning journey.
